Crust:
1 ½ cup flour
1 tsp baking poder
A pincho f salt
2 tsp vanilla sugar
1 tbsp lemon rind
1 egg beaten
¼ cup sugar
100g butter
Filling:
3 eggs
¾ cup sugar
2 tsp vanilla sugar
100g melted butter
6oz heavy cream
500g quark
1 ½ tsp cornstarch
A pinch of salt
Oven 150ºC
Baking pan with parchment paper
In a food processor combine flour with baking powder and salt and process a few times. Add vanilla sugar, sugar, lemon peel and rub in the butter and pulse until obtain crumbs. Take it off the processor, make a ball and wrap in film. Take to the fridge for 1 hour.
In a stand-mixer beat egg yolks with sugar until foamy and pale. Add butter and beat again. Then add heavy cream and beat. Add quark and stir until combine. Whisk egg whites with a pinch of salt until very stiff. Fold in gently in the quark mixture. Add sifted cornstarch a little at a time.
Take the dough and roll it twice. It is a very difficult dough! Press it in the pan. Pour in the filling into the crust. Wobble the pan back and forth until the surface is smooth. Trim the dough living 2 ½ cm. Bake for 50 to 60 minutes until risen and golden. It resembles a souffle (it sinks in the middle and that’s ok). Turn the oven off and leave it for 15 m. Remove and cool for 1 hour. Refrigerate for several hours before releasing the pan.
