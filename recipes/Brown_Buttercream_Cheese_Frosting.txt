115g unsalted butter room temperature
340g cream cheese
480g confectioner’s sugar
2 tsp vanilla extract
½ tsp salt
Slice butter up into pieces and place in a skillet. Melt over medium heat, stirring occasionally. Once melted, the butter begins to foam. After 5-8 minutes it will begin to brown. Once browned, remove from heat, pour into a heat proof bowl. Refrigerate until solid.
Beat the solid brown butter until creamy. Add cream cheese and beat until combined, smooth and creamy. Add vanilla extract, salt ang sugar. Beat on low speed for 1 minute and then in high speed for 2-3 minutes. If you want the frosting a little thicker, add ¼ cup more.
