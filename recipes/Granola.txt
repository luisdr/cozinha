Combine oil or butter, apple sauce, honey or maple syrup. Pour this mixture over the dry ingredients and toss together.
Transfer to the baking sheet, spread and take to oven. Bake for 40 minutes or until golden brown. After 20 minutes, stir because it becomes golden brown around the baking sheet. Stir occasionally so the mixture browns evenly. The brown it gets the crunchy it will be. The granola may still be sticky when removed from the oven, but it will become crisp and dry as it cools. Stir in the dried fruits, Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator.
